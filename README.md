### Issues and Facts
* By design, and for a good reason, web browsers disallow auto-play  
for videos when they are not muted, unless you interact with the page first
* The volume slider in Reddit videos doesn't actually match the volume  
of the video, but this user script does.
* When using custom default volume, the only way to change the volume  
by the slider, is to do so when the video is playing, as it would always  
use the default volume when played after paused.
